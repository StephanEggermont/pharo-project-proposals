## Google Summer of Code 2018

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a global program focused on introducing students to open source software development. Students work on a 3 month programming project with an open source organization during their break from university. 

If you are a student looking for list of topics and their details for GSoC 2018 please see [gsoc.pharo.org](http://gsoc.pharo.org/) or [Topics.md](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo-project-proposals/blob/gh-pages/Topics.md).

Also, join the chat forums on discord or mailing lists ([forum.world.st/Pharo-f1294836.html](http://forum.world.st/Pharo-f1294836.html)) to engage in discussions with the mentors and Pharo developers/users.
